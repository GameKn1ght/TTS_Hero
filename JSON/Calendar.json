{"notes":[{}],"calendarVersion":"0.8.3","eventsdata":{"importantDates":[],"countOfUniqueEvents":1,"countOfDaysWithEvents":0,"countOfTotalEvents":1},"name":"Calendar of Harptos","description":"The Faerûnian calendar has twelve months that roughly correspond to the months of the Gregorian calendar. Each month has thirty days divided into three ten-day weeks (each week is called a tenday). Scattered throughout the year are five holidays that aren’t considered part of any month. Once every four years, the holiday of Shieldmeet is added to the calendar as a leap day immediately following Midsummer night. Collectively, these days create a cycle similar to what we have on Earth: three 365-day years followed by a leap year.\n\nMonths. The Faerûnian months are Hammer, Alturiak, Ches, Tarsakh, Mirtul, Kythorn, Flamerule, Eleasis, Eleint, Marpenoth, Uktar, and Nightal.\n\nAnnual Holidays. The annual holidays are Midwinter (between Hammer and Alturiak), Greengrass (between Tarsakh and Mirtul), Midsummer (between Flamerule and Eleasis), Highharvestide (between Eleint and Marpenoth), and the Feast of the Moon (between Uktar and Nightal).\n\n[img:3138889]","monthOffset":"","startAtZero":false,"defaultYear":"1496","showDays":true,"days":["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10"],"daysPerWeek":10,"months":[{"name":"Hammer (Deepwinter)","length":"31","desc":"","reset":true},{"name":"Alturiak (The Claw of Winter)","length":"30","desc":"","reset":true},{"name":"Ches (The Claw of the Sunsets)","length":"30","desc":"","reset":true},{"name":"Tarsakh (The Claw of the Storms)","length":"31","desc":"","reset":true},{"name":"Mirtul (The Melting)","length":"30","desc":"","reset":true},{"name":"Kythorn (The Time of Flowers)","length":"30","desc":"","reset":true},{"name":"Flamerule (Summertide)","length":"31","desc":"","reset":true},{"name":"Eleasis (Highsun)","length":"30","desc":"","reset":true},{"name":"Eleint (The Fading)","length":"31","desc":"","reset":true},{"name":"Marpenoth (Leaffall)","length":"30","desc":"","reset":true},{"name":"Uktar (The Rotting)","length":"31","desc":"","reset":true},{"name":"Nightal (The Drawing Down)","length":"30","desc":"","reset":true}],"monthsPerYear":12,"celestials":[],"celestialBodyCount":0}
